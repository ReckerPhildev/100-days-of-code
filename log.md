### Day 2: April 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I started the imitation of google.com homepage. Struggled a bit with Css elements, DIV element, ids and classes in css. Am glad to have a better understanding about them. I've done the buttons, image and navbar

**Thoughts**: It's been an amazing experience so far, I've always struggled with front end and putting it a way until now,  am glad I have new and in depth insight about it since it's not as bad as I thought

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some exercises on HackerRank.
